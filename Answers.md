1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a library that assists with developing view in the MVC architectural pattern. It allows us to combine HTML and JS instead of separating these two components of a web page. It also allows us to develop with a more declarative approach through the use of state.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

Think about the web page in terms of components and the flow of the component hierarcy. 

3. Describe state.

State is data held by a component that is private and controlled by the component. It allows us to update our component based on the current state. 

4. Describe props.

Props are properties that we pass from a parent component to a child component. These props sit in a props object that we can then access as read-only values. 

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. Examples include fetching data from an API. Side effects can also cause a component to return a different output for the same state and props.
